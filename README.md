# **KeyRush ‚Äì AI-Powered Typing Speed & Accuracy Analyzer**

**KeyRush** is a **modern, interactive web application** that helps users **improve typing speed and accuracy** while providing **AI-powered insights**. It measures your **typing speed (WPM)**, **accuracy**, and **mistakes**, and then predicts your **skill level**‚Äî**Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced**‚Äîusing a **TensorFlow.js neural network**, all **within the browser**.

## **‚ú® Key Highlights**

- **Interactive Typing Test:** Type **full paragraphs** and see results **after completion** for a focused experience.  
- **AI-Powered Skill Prediction:** Neural network evaluates **WPM** and **accuracy** to classify typing skill.  
- **Privacy-Friendly:** All processing happens **locally in-browser**; **no user data is stored**.  
- **Random Paragraphs & Restartable Tests:** Each session is unique, encouraging **continuous practice**.  
- **Clean UI/UX:** Simple and responsive design for an **engaging user experience**.  

---

## **üìã Features**

- Tracks **typing speed** (Words Per Minute).  
- Measures **accuracy (%)** and counts **mistakes**.  
- **AI prediction** of typing skill level.  
- **Random paragraph generator** for variety.  
- **Restart button** for continuous practice.  
- Runs **entirely in-browser** with **no backend** required.  

---

## **‚öôÔ∏è How It Works**

1. User is presented with a **random paragraph**.  
2. User types the paragraph in the input box.  
3. Upon completion, the app calculates:  
   - **Words Per Minute (WPM)**  
   - **Accuracy (%)**  
   - **Mistakes made**  
4. The **AI model** predicts the **typing skill level**.  
5. User can click **Restart** to try a new paragraph and repeat the test.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **AI:** TensorFlow.js (Neural Network for real-time skill prediction)  
- **Browser-Based:** Runs entirely on the client-side (no server required)

## **üíª Installation & Usage**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhanshribandkar/typing_speed_estimator.git
```
2. Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd typing_speed_estimator
```
Open the project in your preferred code editor (VS Code recommended):

```bash
code .
```
All the project files are already included:

- `index.html` ‚Üí main webpage
- `style.css` ‚Üí styling
- `script.js` ‚Üí typing logic
- `model.js` ‚Üí AI model for skill prediction

### Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.  
2. You will see a **random paragraph** displayed.  
3. Type the paragraph in the input box as accurately and quickly as possible.  
4. After completing the paragraph, the app will display:  
   - **Words Per Minute (WPM)**  
   - **Accuracy (%)**  
   - **Mistakes made**  
   - **AI-predicted skill level** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)  
5. Click the **Restart** button to try another paragraph and continue practicing.
